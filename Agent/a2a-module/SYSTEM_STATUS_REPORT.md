# AR Glass Q&A System - Current Status Report

**Date**: August 22, 2025  
**Status**: Network Issues Blocking OpenAI API Integration

## 🎯 Project Overview
Android XR AR Glass Q&A System using OpenAI GPT-4V Realtime API for real-time visual question answering.

## ✅ Successfully Completed

### 1. Hardware & Emulator Setup
- ✅ Android XR emulator running
- ✅ Logitech webcam connected and working
- ✅ Microphone configured and enabled
- ✅ Camera processing 640x480 frames

### 2. Application Development  
- ✅ App compiled successfully
- ✅ App installed on emulator
- ✅ Camera2Manager processing frames
- ✅ OpenAI API key configured in build.gradle.kts

### 3. Worker Agents Architecture
- ✅ 4 A2A Worker Agents running (Perception, Vision, UX/TTS, Logger)
- ✅ JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol communication
- ✅ Agent coordination system active

## ❌ Critical Issues Blocking Progress

### 1. Network Connectivity (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Problem**: Emulator has no internet access
- Cannot reach api.openai.com
- DNS resolution fails (ping 8.8.8.8 = 100% packet loss)
- OpenAI Realtime API connection impossible

**Impact**: Core Q&A functionality completely blocked

**Attempted Solutions**:
- Emulator restart with DNS settings
- Network configuration changes
- Proxy settings cleared

**Status**: UNRESOLVED

### 2. User Interface Missing Components
**Problem**: Essential UI elements not visible
- No text input field for questions
- No capture button for image sending
- No voice input controls
- Only camera feed visible

**Impact**: User cannot interact with system

**Status**: Being addressed by UX/TTS Agent

### 3. Excessive Logging
**Problem**: Debug logs covering screen
- Camera processing logs spamming display
- Error messages overwhelming interface

**Status**: PARTIALLY RESOLVED (log levels reduced)

## 🔧 Immediate Action Items

### Priority 1: Network Fix
1. Restart emulator with explicit network configuration
2. Test connection to 8.8.8.8 and api.openai.com
3. Verify OpenAI API connectivity
4. Enable full Q&A functionality

### Priority 2: UI Completion
1. Add text input field for questions
2. Add capture button for image sending
3. Add voice recording controls
4. Test user interaction flow

### Priority 3: Integration Testing
1. Test camera -> OpenAI pipeline
2. Test voice input -> API
3. Test response playback
4. Validate full user experience
